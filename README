Example moosefs deployment using vagrant.

Running on centos7 and using puppet for configuration deployment. 

You will need https://github.com/kusnier/vagrant-persistent-storage plugin for this cluster

Usage: well, not really tested all that much, but:

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-persistent-storage
    vagrant up
